            <p class="description">•	Title: Review and Investigation of Orchestration Frameworks for Multi-Cloud Environment at Wunder Carpool, Hamburg

              Description:
              As part of my experience at Wunder Carpool, Hamburg, I have conducted an in-depth investigation and review of various orchestration frameworks in a multi-cloud environment. Specifically, I have worked extensively with Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesos, focusing on their integration with cloud platforms such as AWS and DigitalOcean.
              
              In addition, I have developed a comprehensive decision matrix that assists organizations in selecting the most suitable container orchestration tool from multiple options for their specific project environment.
              
              Technologies Worked On:
              
              Docker Swarm
              Kubernetes
              Mesos/DCOS
              Terraform
              AWS
              DigitalOcean
              
              By leveraging my expertise in these technologies, I have gained valuable insights and practical experience in orchestrating containers within diverse cloud environments.
